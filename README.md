## Developer Notes

The frontend is a Vanilla JS web-app that talks to a Serverless API function. vreddit-direct is designed to be hosted on Vercel.

To setup a dev environment -

```
# Install the Vercel CLI
~/Dev/vreddit-direct ❯ npm install -g vercel

# Install the dependencies
~/Dev/vreddit-direct ❯ yarn # or npm install

# Stand-up the dev server (for testing the Serverless functions)
~/Dev/vreddit-direct ❯ vercel dev
```
